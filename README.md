# Fullstack-(MERN)-Community-WebApp
A Fullstack (MERN) Social Web App for Local Communities created with:
- Node.js
- React.js
- Express
- MongoDB 
- and several middlewares
The website's name is Mahalle. It is a Turkish word, meaning neigbourhood. The good thing is that this word also sounds like German, if one spells it like this: Ma Halle. That sounds like meine Halle, meaning "my hall". :) 
Because many people from German and Turkish origin dwell in my area, I thought this is a nice name for a local community social app.
